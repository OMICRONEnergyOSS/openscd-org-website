<h2>An IEC 61850 Engineering Tool</h2>
<p>
  OpenSCD is a tool for creating and manipulating IEC 61850 system configuration
  language (SCL) files.
</p>
<p>
  Originally intended for just fixing insufficiently populated SCL files, its
  functionality has evolved and offers now most features of a system
  configuration tool (SCT).
</p>
<p>It is instantly usable as a web application.</p>
<p>
  As it is Open-Source, any interested party can add functionality.<br />
  The next feature is always the one you are working on.
