<h2>About OpenSCD</h2>
<p>
  OpenSCD was initially developed at OMICRON out of a need for a tool to improve
  IEC 61850 System Configuration Description (SCD) files.
</p>
<p>
  Many SCD files lacked information about the substation structure and the
  conducting equipment, which is stored in the substation section. To improve
  the understanding of the context and the efficiency of working with these
  data, the information in the substation section had to be added or augmented.
  This would be doable with most SCL tools provided by vendors, but these are
  not always easily available for occasional users, who are not doing IEC 61850
  engineering full-time.
</p>
<p>
  When the initial feature set for improving SCD files was implemented, OpenSCD
  was made Open-Source to become developed further by new stakeholders.
