<h2>How to get OpenSCD</h2>
<p>
  The original community version of OpenSCD is a
  <a class="a_main" href="https://openscd.github.io/" target="_blank">
    web application
  </a>
  available from GitHub.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this version of OpenSCD does not store any data "in the internet"
  or "in the cloud".<br />
  Only the application is loaded from the internet, the processing of the SCL
  data is done locally on your computer and the data never leave your computer.
</p>
<p>
  OpenSCD can also be installed locally.<br />
  Information about this is on the
  <a href="https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki">OpenSCD Wiki on github</a>.
</p>
