# Other Projects Using OpenSCD

[CoMPAS](https://lfenergy.org/projects/compas/) is a project about IEC 61850 engineering, hosted by LF Energy. The main driver is Alliander.  
OpenSCD is used as a graphical front-end there.

[OpenEnergyTools](https://github.com/OpenEnergyTools) is a test-bed repository with a [fork of OpenSCD](https://openenergytools.github.io/scl-editor) including plugin prototypes.  
While its maintainer Jakob Vogelsang does not recommend it for productive use, it serves as a valuable example for developers and can be used to preview upcoming features.
