# An IEC 61850 Engineering Tool

OpenSCD is a tool for creating and manipulating IEC 61850 system configuration
language (SCL) files.

Originally intended for just fixing insufficiently populated SCL files, its functionality has evolved and offers now most features of a system configuration tool (SCT).

It is instantly usable as a web application.

As it is Open-Source, any interested party can add functionality. The next feature is always the one you are working on.
