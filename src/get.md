# How to get OpenSCD

The original community version of OpenSCD is a [web application](https://openscd.github.io/) available from GitHub.

Note that this version of OpenSCD does not store any data "in the internet" or "in the cloud".

Only the application is loaded from the internet, the processing of the SCL data is done locally on your computer and the data never leave your computer.

OpenSCD can also be installed locally.

Information about this is on the (OpenSCD Wiki on github)[https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki].
